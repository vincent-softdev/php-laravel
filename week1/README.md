# Description

This project is just for copying and pasting. This is one of the ways I am learning. I will try to copy by typing exactly what they do, one by one, to become familiar with the code. 

After that, I will actually start learning from the basics. This approach will help me learn faster because after copying the code, I will have many questions about why and how it works. Then, when I truly study the code, I will find the answers and reinforce my understanding through active recall.
